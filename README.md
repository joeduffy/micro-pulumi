# Pulumi Microservices Examples

This repo contains an example of a custom microservices framework built using Pulumi primitives.

It supports higher level microservice patterns, like sidecars, and can retarget AWS ECS and Kubernetes
clusters at deployment time with minimal changes to your application.

An example of a microservice using an NGINX reverse proxy sidecar can be found [here](/examples/nginx-revproxy-sidecar).
